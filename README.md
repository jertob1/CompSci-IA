# Control Systems for Sustainable Water Valves  
**KU Leuven & Comate**

## Overview  
This project was developed during my internship at **KU Leuven** in collaboration with **Comate**, a leading engineering and design company. The research, led by a master thesis student, focused on evaluating the performance of **eco-friendly water valves** for sustainable water development. My role was to design and implement a **data acquisition and control system** for an experimental setup.  
Additionally, I used this project as the basis for my **IB Computer Science HL Internal Assessment**.

## Features  
### Sensor Integration & Process Control  
- Developed software to control **three pressure sensors** and a **servo motor** using **Arduino**.  
- Enabled precise valve operation and real-time data collection.  

### Data Logging & Storage  
- Implemented a **SQLite relational database** to store and manage experimental data.  
- Facilitated **serial communication** between Arduino and a Java application for seamless data transfer.  

### Interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI)  
- Designed an intuitive **Java-based GUI** for querying and visualizing sensor data.  
- Enabled researchers to access and analyze valve performance efficiently.

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming:** Java, Arduino (C++), SQLite  
- **Hardware:** Pressure Sensors, Servo Motor  
- **Tools:** Onshape (CAD), Serial Communication Protocols
